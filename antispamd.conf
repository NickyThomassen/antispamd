################################################################################
# The Introduction
#
# Please read this, or expect some funny time consuming results.
#
# This configuration is build around key/value pairs, and accepts both regular
# comments, using the number sign (#), and end-of-line comments. In addition are
# spaces accepted, both before and after each key/value and the equal sign (=).
#
# Some functioning examples of this syntax includes:
# # This is a comment.
# key=value
# key= value
# key = value
#   key  =  value  
# key = value # This is a comment.
#
# No keys or values contains spaces in them, but uses underscore (_) to ease
# readability.
#
# '-f /path/to/config.conf' takes precedence if the standard file
# (/etc/default/antispamd.conf) also exists. The standard file does not need
# to exist if '-f /path/to/config.conf' is used.
#
# The default values is to do as little work as possible.
# 'yes' enables a feature while anything else disables it, unless it takes a
# number as value, in which case a conservative standard is set if the
# parameter is missing from the configuration.
#
# The program name is 'antispamd', and the PID-file goes in
# /var/run/antispamd.pid.
# This can't be changed, since it could break the init script. Sorry.
#
# Cheking for a existing PID file happens after checking and validating the
# configuration, thus changes in configuration may be conducted and checked for
# syntax errors while there is a running daemon. To do so, simply run the
# program with the -c flag.
# If logging to file is set, root permission is needed to validate.
#
# Remember to create the directorys. See further down for details.

# The Settings
#
# How often, in seconds, should the program execute.
# Note that the timer starts once the program has finished a run.
# Once every minute: sleep_time = 60
# Once every hour: sleep_time = 3600
# Once every day: sleep_time = 86400
# 
# Standard is once every hour.
sleep_time = 3600

# Should sa-learn be used.
# "no" is standard.
use_sa_learn = no

# Prepended text on the files. This is used to distinguish ham from spam.
#
# Please note that to avoid feeding SpamAssassin wrong files, they must start
# with pre_hams or pre_spam and end on .dove. In addition wildcard matching is
# used, meaning antispamd will match like this:
# pre_hams-*.dove
# pre_spam-*.dove
# Where the wildcard (*) part needs to be unique within the delete_age timeframe
# set below (so a simple numbersystem based on the number of mails in
# $process_dir won't work, since there will be conflicting filenames when files
# are moved into $archive).
#
# Standard, pre_hams = ham
# Standard, pre_spam = spam
pre_hams = ham
pre_spam = spam

# Path to the working directorys, which needs to exist. The directorys is only
# needed and checked if use_sa_learn or delete_old is set and sa-learn is found.
# vmail:root and 770 is recommended on both directorys, or whatever user runs
# the mailserver.
#
# process_dir is where Dovecot dumps mails, while archive_dir is where this
# program moves processed mails to.
#
# Standard, process_dir = /var/spool/dovecot-antispam
# Standard, archive_dir = /var/spool/dovecot-antispam/archive
process_dir = /var/spool/dovecot-antispam
archive_dir = /var/spool/dovecot-antispam/archive

# The script can measure the execution time and log it.
# "no" is standard.
execution_time = no

# Should old files be deleted, and if yes, at what age in whole days.
# "no" is standard.
# If delete_old is set, but not delete_age, then 30 days is used.
delete_old = no
delete_age = 30

# Should logging to syslog be used.
# "no" is standard.
use_syslog = no

# And, if syslog should be used, what facility should there be logged to.
# "mail" is standard.
#
# Please see Wikipedia for details on facilities
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility_Levels
syslog_facility = mail

# Should logging to file be used.
# "no" is standard.
use_logfile = no

# Logdir to use; logname is antispamd.log, and can't be changed. Sorry
# Please indicate the path without any trailing slash
# Standard, log_dir = /var/log
log_dir = /var/log

# Defines how much there will be logged to syslog, file and terminal.
# 0 = Off    (Logs nothing).
# 1 = Errors (Logs only errors).
# 2 = Normal (Level 1 + no. of files to train/delete and excecution time).
# 3 = Debug  (Levels 1 and 2 + filenames).
# A loglevel of 0 is standard.
log_level = 0
